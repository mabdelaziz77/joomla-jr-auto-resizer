## 🚀 The Hook: Stop Bloating Your Website

Uploading raw images straight from a camera or smartphone often results in files ranging from **5MB to 20MB+**. This kills your website's performance, destroys your Core Web Vitals, and frustrates your users on mobile connections.

**JR Auto Resizer** is a native Joomla plugin that intercepts these uploads. It automatically resizes and optimizes your images to specific dimensions and converts them to modern formats (like WebP) the moment you click save. 

**Keep your site fast without changing your workflow.**

## ✨ Features

- **Native Joomla Integration**: Works seamlessly with Joomla 5's content events. No complex setup or third-party dependencies required.
- **Customizable Precision**: Define exactly how you want your images handled. Set your preferred max-width, quality levels, and formats for both Intro and Full Article images.
- **Non-Destructive Processing**: Choose whether to keep your original high-resolution uploads or delete them to save disk space.
- **Modern Standards**: Automatically generates WebP versions and small variants for responsive `srcset` support.

## 📦 Installation & Usage

1. **Download**: Grab the latest release ZIP.
2. **Install**: In your Joomla Administrator, go to **System → Install → Extensions** and upload the ZIP.
3. **Enable**: Go to **System → Plugins**, search for "JR Auto Resizer," and enable it.
4. **Configure**: Click into the plugin settings to set your desired widths and compression quality.
